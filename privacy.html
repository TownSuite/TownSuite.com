                               unless such use or disclosure is permitted without your consent pursuant to applicable privacy laws or this Privacy Policy.

                          <p>Unless an exemption applies under applicable privacy laws, your knowledge and consent

                          <p>Principle 6 – Accuracy</p>
                          <p>We will keep personal information as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.</p>

                          <p>We protect personal information with safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information by maintaining appropriate and commercially reasonable physical, procedural and technical security with respect to its offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of personal information.
